# A New Way Of Coding

I have been looking for a way of coding and documentation for a long time. This is my current coding flow.

1. Write some code and get it working.
2. Write a Markdown document about the code and use include tags in that document to include the code in the document.

## Where I am going

1. In the past I made a script to convert Python code into Markdown, including Markdown formatted comments in the code. I may dig this out or rewrite it to make the source code more like a literate program.
2. Make sure that all these coding programs are checked into Git.
3. Make the process of generating the documentation more automatic.
4. Make an index to the code.
5. Make sure the actual source documentation and extensions is also included and checked in.
