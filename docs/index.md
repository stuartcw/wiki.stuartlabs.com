# Stuart's Knowledge and Opinion Repository

{{ date.strftime('%B %d, %Y') }}

> For this you keep a lab notebook. Everything gets written down, formally,
  so that you know at all times where you are, where you’ve been, where you’re
  going and where you want to get. In scientific work and electronics technology
  this is necessary because otherwise the problems get so complex you get lost
  in them and confused and forget what you know and what you don’t know and
  have to give up.
